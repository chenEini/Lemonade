# Lemonade Frontend Role Assignment Instructions

- Download and read the [assignment instructions](https://github.com/Lemonade-Makers/frontend-v1-scaffold-js/files/5479770/Frontend.Home.Assignment.pdf).

- Fork this repo into your personal Github account (you can clone it as a private repository if you want to remain discreet).

- Clone the forked repository.

- Run `npm install`. You'll need Node installed with version 10 or higher.

- Start coding.

We highly recommend to use [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [eslint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) and [prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) extensions for this exercise. If you prefer working without auto-formatting, just remove the `.vscode` folder.

- Once you're done:
  - *If your forked repository is public* - push your changes to your forked version and send us a link back.
  - *If your forked repository is private* - you can email us back an archived version of the final code.

Good luck!
